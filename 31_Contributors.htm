<h1>BioAPI Reference Implementation: Contributors</h1>

The following companies and individuals have made this possible:

<p>First, of course, are the many talented individuals who have so ably
represented their respective companies at the BioAPI Consortium
meetings, leading up to the pulication of the specification, without
whom we wouldn't have had anything to implement a reference of.

<p><a href="http://www.intel.com/">Intel</a>'s Open Source
<a href="http://developer.intel.com/ial/security/">CDSA/HRS</a>
framework provided the original structure, and indeed much of this code
is essentially unchanged from that time.  David Bowler from Intel
provided significant development assistance and patiently answered many
questions, without which this would have taken much longer and been of
much lower quality.  David has also remained active on the mailing list
since the release of the reference implementation.

<p><a href="http://www.bioscrypt.com/">Bioscrypt Inc.</a> (formerly
Mytec Technologies Inc.) hosted the first development workshop, and also
hosts the various mailing lists.  Colin Soutar is the chair of the reference
implementation.  Greg Schmidt was lead developer, maintainer of the source
control system, debugger of MDS and the framework, wrote these works of
lasting literary value that you are currently enjoying, and has remained
active on the mailing list.  We appreciate Bioscrypt's commitment of
resources to this project.

<p><a href="http://www.saflink.com/">SAFLINK</a> hosted the second
development workshop, and contributed much of Tim Brown's time to the
development process.  Tim was responsible for the sample application,
among other things.

<p><a href="http://www.iridiantech.com/">Iridian Technologies</a> (formerly
Iriscan) contributed the time of Garrett Deacon, whose most visible
responsibility was handling the various schemas, including the MDSEdit utility.

<p>Tomoko Onaka of Visionics,
Harry Trautmann of Softpro,
Roy Myers of Ankari,
Torsten Meister of Touchless Sensor Technology,
and
Cory Womacks of Saflink
contributed detailed bug reports and usually patches to fix the bugs.

<p>Please contribute to the project so that your name too may be recorded
for all time in this hallowed location.
