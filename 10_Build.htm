<h1>BioAPI Reference Implementation: Building</h1>

The reference implementation was developed under Microsoft Visual
Studio, and workspaces and projects are included for building all the
various projects.

<p>The easiest way to go about it is to load the /build/build.dsw
workspace, set "build" as the active project, and build it.  This will
ensure that all projects in the system are compiled.  All files in the
projects use relative paths, so it is important to maintain the directory
structure of the source.

<p>There are three configurations: debug, memdebug and release.  Debug and
release are exactly what you would expect.  Memdebug is the same as
debug, but defines BioAPI_MEMCHECK_ON, which tells files to use enhanced
versions of memory functions (malloc, free, realloc, calloc) which are
intended to track memory allocations and give a report of any memory
leaks, and where they were allocated from.
