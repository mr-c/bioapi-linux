<h1>BioAPI Reference Implementation: To Do</h1>

You may have thought the reference implementation was complete, but
there are a number of things that still need to be done.  Most of these
don't impact on the functionality of the code, but are more in the vein
of "cleaning up", so that, in addition to having a binary we can be
proud of, we get to a collection of source code that we can be equally
proud of.

<ol>

<li><b>"Insert" callback</b>

<p>This first item is part interpretation issue, part philosophical
decision, and probably parts of other things that we haven't yet
realized.  In the third paragraph of the definition of the
BioAPI_ModuleLoad function, it is stated that "When a BSP is loaded, it
should raise an 'insert' event immediately if there is a sensor already
attached."  In the case of many biometrics which can't (for a variety of
reasons) detect insertion of the sensor, "immediately" is interpreted in
such a way that the insert callback is called before the
BioAPI_ModuleLoad function has returned.

<p>The most obvious way to interpret the insert callback is for the
application to assume that it can call BioAPI_ModuleAttach immediately
on receipt of the callback.  However, this has the result that
BioAPI_ModuleAttach is effectively called from within BioAPI_ModuleLoad,
because both the framework and the (sample) application are
single-threaded.  This call to BioAPI_ModuleAttach will fail, because
the framework has certain critical internal data structures locked
already.

<p>One solution to this would be to require that the application include
some technique to queue these callback events and only call them when it
knows it is safe.  This seems, to some, to be a large onus to put on
many applications, and application developers.  This onus could be eased
somewhat with some additions to the BioAPI utility library.  A simple
version of this (perhaps not suitable for industrial strength applications,
and certainly not usable by any application which simultaneously loads
more than one module in different threads) has been implemented in the
provided sample app; see the code that deals with g_immediate_attach in main.c.

<p>Another solution would be to make the framework more intelligent about
when it is safe to issue callbacks.  This would certainly require that
the framework become multi-threaded, but even then is a very tricky
issue, because the same instance of the framework may be called from
multiple threads within a process, or even from multiple processes.

<p>This issue remains open pending further mailing list discussion to
determine the best solution.

<p><li><b>Enhanced sample app</b>

<p>The sample app is quite simple, making use of very few API calls.  It
should be enhanced to become a general-purpose testing tool, with
options for enabling and disabling various optional functionality, in
order to enable testers to give the framework a good workout.

<p><li><b>Application controlled GUI and client/server BSPs</b>

<p>No BSPs have yet been written which support these concepts, nor are
there applications which can make use of them.  Therefore, these parts
of the framework have not yet been tested.  These options need to be
implemented by someone so that the framework can be tested.  Ideally,
these would be fed back into the password BSP and sample app, for
purposes of regression testing framework enhancements and bug fixes.

<p><li><b>Other testing</b>

<p>While a fair bit of testing has been done, the code has not been
subjected to a rigorous workout.  More thorough testing of all aspects
of MDS, the framework, included BSPs, and install apps needs to be done.
In the (unlikely!) event of bugs, these need to be fixed, and the fixes
fed back into the central source repository.

<p><li><b>CSSM types and error codes</b>

<p>We have replaced the original CSSM (CDSA) data types and error codes in
many places, but not everywhere.  We are still using the CDSA port
library, and much of MDS is unmodified, so the CSSM types and error
codes are still required in these places.  Instances of the old names
should be reviewed to determine whether the CSSM or BioAPI names are
most appropriate.

<p><li><b>Pruning</b>

<p>While many CDSA files have been identified as unnecessary for the BioAPI
reference implementation, it is almost certain that there are some
included here that are not needed.  These should be identified and
removed from the distribution.

<p><li><b>Installation</b>

<p>The uninstallation currently does not remove bioapi100.dll and
bioapi_mds300.dll from the system (system32 for NT) directory.  Nor does
it clean up the MDS data store.
